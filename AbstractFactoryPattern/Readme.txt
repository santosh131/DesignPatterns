Whenever we need to create different kind of related objects (of a group/set) then
Abstract Factory Pattern is a choice. It provides different kind of Factories. 
Each factory will create a particular kind of related objects. 
That's why sometime we call Abstract Factory Pattern as Factory of Factories.
Factory Method Pattern provide one kind on objects only (in our examples all those objects were of type ILaptop).
